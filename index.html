                    This application will improve std Managementand help the manager and reduce errors which may be caused while entering data in the book.The main objective of this project is to manage details of the customer, product and information about the payment which is stored in database and can be modified further.Manager has his own login page which helps him to keep his transaction secure.He can access details of customer, payment, online shipment and component. We tried to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete MySQL operations through this project.</p>

This application is very useful for the people to track current price of the bitcoin and also convert the price of bitcoin to other currencies like USD and INR. We choose this domain becuase in this digital era people are becoming more passoniate about cryptocurriencies like bitcoin. We have used the android studio software for this project and the programming language is JAVA. The backend used is SQLite.</p>

                <h3>Final Project</h3>
                <h2>BONE FRACTURE DETECTION USING IMAGE PROCESSING</h2>
                <p> To detect the fracture in
                    the bone is important in medical field. In this work X-ray/CT images are used to for
                    bone fracture detection. Proposed system will detect the fracture of the bone from input
                    X-ray image. The proposed system has three main steps namely, preprocessing, feature
                    extraction and classification. Image Pre-processing involves image enhancement, edge
                    detection. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for feature extraction and classification.
                    The images are further classified into Normal or fractured bone. If bone is fractured then
                    it locates the fractured area with the contour technique for line detection in the image.
                    This model can achieve accuracy of 90%</p>
